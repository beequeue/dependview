# dependview

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

The aim of this project is to compare versions of dependencies between projects so that a combined list of dependencies can be seen.  Also, out-of-date depdendencies can more easily be spotted.

It is very much a scratch-your-own-itch project so features may seem a little specific to my own situation at the moment.

Further documentation will be added when a minimal working version is ready.
